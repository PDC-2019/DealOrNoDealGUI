# DealOrNoDealGUI

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version of a Deal Or No Deal game. 
The code to create the game needed to be clear, well-designed and follow Object-Oriented Programming practices. The program must have a database element, and must be able to achieve database interactions and operations (input/output). 

The graphical interface had to be easy for users to interact with, with clear instructions and neat design. The class structure needed to be clear and have an implementation of design patterns. The code should also have set units tests covering important functionality.

## Gameplay

#### *Scenario 1: Normal input, winning the game*

An input of 2 from the user would call game instructions stored in a text file to the screen. An input of 1 would begin the game. An input of 1 would begin the game.
